### **Introduction**
This program allows the user to input a number and determines whether the number is negative, positive, or zero. It utilizes conditional statements (if, else if, and else) to perform the check and provide the corresponding output message.

### **Code**

```c
// [Desc: Program to check whether a number is positive or negative.]
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int number;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    if (number > 0)
        printf("The number is positive.\n");
    else if (number < 0)
        printf("The number is negative.\n");
    else
        printf("The number is zero.\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### **Possible Output**
```
Enter a number: 5
The number is positive.
```
```
Enter a number: -7
The number is negative.
```
```
Enter a number: 0
The number is zero.
```

### **Description**
* The program begins by declaring a variable number to store the user input.
* The user is prompted to enter a number using the printf() function.
* The scanf() function is used to read the user input and store it in the number variable.
* The program then uses conditional statements (if, else if, and else) to check the value of number.
* If number is greater than 0, the program prints "The number is positive." using the printf() function.
* If number is less than 0, the program prints "The number is negative." using the printf() function.
* If number is neither greater than 0 nor less than 0 (i.e., it is equal to 0), the program prints "The number is zero." using the printf() function.
* Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
### **Conclusion**
This program allows the user to input a number and determines whether it is negative, positive, or zero. It demonstrates the use of conditional statements to perform different actions based on the value of a variable. The output message indicates the nature of the entered number.

### **Description**
* The program declares variables to store the marks for each subject: cProgramming, physics, maths, appliedMechanics, and basicElectrical.
* The program also declares variables for the full marks (FM), passing marks (PM), total marks obtained, percentage, and grade.
* The user is prompted to enter the marks for each subject using the printf() function, and the values are stored using the scanf() function.
* The program calculates the total marks obtained by adding the marks for all subjects together.
* The program then checks if any subject marks exceed the full marks. If any subject marks are greater than FM, it displays an error message.
* Next, the program checks if any subject marks are below the passing marks (PM). If any subject marks are below PM, it displays a failure message.
* If the student has not failed, the program calculates the percentage by dividing the total marks obtained by the product of full marks and the number of subjects.
* Based on the percentage, the program assigns a grade using if and else if statements.
* Finally, the program displays a success message, the calculated percentage, and the assigned grade using the printf() function.
### **Conclusion**
This program allows the user to input marks for five subjects and calculates the total marks obtained, percentage, and grade. It checks if any subject marks exceed the full marks or are below the passing marks. If the student has not failed, it assigns a grade based on the percentage and displays the result.

>## <span id="q10">10. WAP to input a number from user. If user enters a number less than or equal to zero then program should just display the number. If user enters 1 the program should display output as neither prime nor composite, if user enters 2 the program should display output as smallest and only even prime number. If user enters any number greater than 2 the program should check whether the number is prime or not, also if the number is not prime the program should display whether it is even or odd</span>

### **Introduction**
This program allows the user to input a number and checks whether the number is prime or not. It also provides additional information if the number is not prime, such as whether it is even or odd. The program handles different scenarios based on the input number.

### **Code**

```c
// [Desc: Program to check if a number is prime or not.]
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int number, isPrime = 1;

    // Input a number from the user
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    if (number <= 0)
    {
        // Number is less than or equal to zero
        printf("Number: %d\n", number);
    }
    else if (number == 1)
    {
        // Number is 1
        printf("Neither prime nor composite\n");
    }
    else if (number == 2)
    {
        // Number is 2, the smallest and only even prime number
        printf("Smallest and only even prime number\n");
    }
    else
    {
        // Number is greater than 2
        for (int i = 2; i <= number / 2; i++)
        {
            if (number % i == 0)
            {
                // Number is not prime
                isPrime = 0;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isPrime)
        {
            // Number is prime
            printf("Number is prime\n");
        }
        else
        {
            // Number is not prime
            printf("Number is not prime\n");

            if (number % 2 == 0)
            {
                // Number is even
                printf("Number is even\n");
            }
            else
            {
                // Number is odd
                printf("Number is odd\n");
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Possible Output**
```
Enter a number: 0
Number: 0
```
```
Enter a number: 1
Neither prime nor composite
```
```
Enter a number: 2
Smallest and only even prime number```
```
```
Enter a number: 17
Number is prime
```
```
Enter a number: 12
Number is not prime
Number is even
```
```
Enter a number: 27
Number is not prime
Number is odd
```

### **Description**
* The program declares variables to store the input number (number) and a flag to track whether the number is prime (isPrime).
* The user is prompted to enter a number using the printf() function, and the value is stored using the scanf() function.
* The program then checks different scenarios based on the input number:
* If the number is less than or equal to zero, it displays the number itself.
* If the number is 1, it displays "Neither prime nor composite" because 1 is neither prime nor composite.
* If the number is 2, it displays "Smallest and only even prime number" because 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.
* For any number greater than 2, the program checks if it is prime by iterating from 2 to half of the number and checking if any number divides the input number evenly.
* If the number is divisible by any number, it sets the isPrime flag to 0, indicating that the number is not prime.
* If no number divides the input number evenly, the isPrime flag remains 1, indicating that the number is prime.
* If the number is prime, it displays "Number is prime."
* If the number is not prime, it displays "Number is not prime" and further checks if the number is even or odd by checking the remainder of dividing the number by 2.
* If the remainder is 0, it displays "Number is even."
* If the remainder is not 0, it displays "Number is odd."
* The program ends with the return 0; statement.

### **Conclusion**
This program allows the user to input a number and determines whether it is prime or not. It handles different scenarios and provides appropriate output based on the input number.
