## 1_dataTypes

This code demonstrates the usage of different data types in C and displays the values, as well as the sizes of the variables.

---

## 2_1_swapVariables

This code demonstrates swapping the values of two variables using a third variable.

---

## 2_2_swapVariables

This code demonstrates swapping the values of two variables without using a third variable.

---

## 3_areaAndVolumeOfCylinder

This code calculates the area and volume of a cylinder using the given radius and height.

---

## 4_minimum

This code determines the minimum of two numbers entered by the user.

---

## 5_oddOrEven

This code checks whether a number entered by the user is odd or even.

---

## 6_bitwise

This code demonstrates various bitwise operations, such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift.
